Assignment Specification: Profiles, Positions and JQuery
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this next assignment you will extend our simple resume database to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations (CRUD) 
into a Position table that has a many-to-one relationship to our Profile table.

This assignment will use JQuery to dynamically add and delete positions in the add and edit user interface.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Additional Table Required for the Assignment

This assignment will add one more table to the database from the previous assignment. 
We will create a Position table and connect it to the Profile table with a many-to-one relationship.

CREATE TABLE Position (
  position_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  profile_id INTEGER,
  rank INTEGER,
  year INTEGER,
  description TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY(position_id),
  CONSTRAINT position_ibfk_1
    FOREIGN KEY (profile_id)
    REFERENCES Profile (profile_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
