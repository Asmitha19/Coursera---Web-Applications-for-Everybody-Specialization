Assignment Specification: Profiles, Positions, and Education
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this next assignment, you will extend our simple resume database to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations (CRUD) 
into a Education table that has a many-to-one relationship to our Profile table and a many-to-many relationship to an Institution table. 

We will add an jQuery autocomplete field to our user interface.

This assignment will also feature a jQuery auto-complete field when entering the name of the school.

Additional Tables Required for the Assignment

This assignment will add one more table to the database from the previous assignment. 
We will create Education and Institution tables and connect them to the Profile table.

CREATE TABLE Institution (
  institution_id INTEGER NOT NULL KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  UNIQUE(name)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE Education (
  profile_id INTEGER,
  institution_id INTEGER,
  rank INTEGER,
  year INTEGER,
  CONSTRAINT education_ibfk_1
    FOREIGN KEY (profile_id)
    REFERENCES Profile (profile_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT education_ibfk_2
    FOREIGN KEY (institution_id)
    REFERENCES Institution (institution_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY(profile_id, institution_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

You must create the Institution table first so that the CONSTRAINTS in the Education table work properly.

Like in the Position table, the rank column should be used to record the order in which the positions are to be displayed. Do not use the year as the sort key when viewing the data.

You should also pre-insert some University data into the Institution table as follows:

INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('University of Michigan');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('University of Virginia');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('University of Oxford');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('University of Cambridge');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('Stanford University');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('Duke University');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('Michigan State University');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('Mississippi State University');
INSERT INTO Institution (name) VALUES ('Montana State University');

This will allow you to have some university names pop up when you are typing ahead in the School field.
