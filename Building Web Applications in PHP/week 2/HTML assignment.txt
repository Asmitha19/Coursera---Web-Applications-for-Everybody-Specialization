Your HTML must pass the validator at: https://validator.w3.org/nu/


Optional: If the HTML validator above suggests you add a lang attribute to the html start tag, it's a warning not an error. 
It is not required for the assignment. There is no example posted here because the lang code has many values, you might like to check out the w3schools HTML ISO Language page.

The title tag must contain your name or the string indicated by the autograder.


You must have at least one example of each of the following tags: span, p, div, h1, and ul

You must have three a tags and three li tags.

You must have some bold text in the document and some italics text in the document but you cannot use the b or i tags. The autograder will only grade HTML, and ignore any CSS.
