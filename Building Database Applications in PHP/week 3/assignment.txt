Finding Cookies and Sessions in a Haystack

Welcome ASMITHA B from Building Database Applications in PHP

This application has stored a cookie named wa4e_secret_cookie in your browser. You must find the value of that cookie and enter it on this form.

You must also figure out your session identifier. It is either a GET parameter or a cookie value named PHPSESSID. 
If you have both a GET parameter and a Cookie, then either session ID will work for this assignment.

This assignment is best completed using "Developer Mode" of your browser.

Enter your values in each of the fields below and press "Submit".
